**The Case for Specialized AI Models: Overcoming the Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs)**

## Abstract

This paper explores the challenges and opportunities associated with developing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for specific tasks. While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general natural language processing, their performance often falls short when applied to highly specialized domains or complex problem spaces. This paper argues that training custom, specialized AI models can offer significant advantages in terms of speed, cost-effectiveness, predictability, reliability, and customization. We present a case study illustrating how a custom-trained AI model was used to address the challenge of automatically converting Figma designs into high-quality code, highlighting the benefits of this approach over using an off-the-shelf LLM.

## Project Structure

* `paper.qmd`: The main Quarto manuscript file containing the white paper.
* `references.bib`: BibTeX file for citations and references.
* `_quarto.yml`: Quarto configuration file for project settings.
* `output`: Folder where rendered output files (HTML, PDF, etc.) will be stored.

## How to Build

1. **Install Quarto:**  If you haven't already, download and install Quarto from [https://quarto.org/](https://quarto.org/).
2. **Render:** Run `quarto render` in your terminal from the project's root directory. This will generate the white paper in HTML and PDF formats (located in the `output` folder).

## Key Contributions

* **Case Study:** A detailed case study demonstrating the advantages of a custom-trained AI model for Figma design to code conversion.
* **Methodology:** A clear breakdown of the steps involved in developing specialized AI models, including problem decomposition, utilizing traditional code, and training on curated datasets.
* **Discussion:** Analysis of the benefits of specialized AI models in terms of speed, cost, predictability, reliability, and customization.
